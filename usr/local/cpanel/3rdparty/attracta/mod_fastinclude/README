mod_fastinclude


DESCRIPTION

This module is intended as a very low overhead way to add content to HTTP 200 requests without modifying anything other than the length of the request. As such, a bucket with the content is added before the EOS bucket should the module not be denied by .htaccess and the file described below exists.

This module allows for the inclusion of JavaScript content at the bottom of the following types of pages:
	text/html


Placement of a file called .fastinclude in a document root will result in the inclusion of the contents of that file in the last bucket of the http response.
